# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot Backend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in core requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (via User Stories)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification's core requirements

## Notes

- All checks passed. The specification is complete and addresses the user's request while adhering to the principle of separating the "what" from the "how." Implementation details provided by the user have been captured as assumptions. The spec is ready for the planning phase.
