I have resolved the issues with the ingestion script. Here is a summary of the changes:

1.  **Corrected Content Source**: The script now correctly points to the `my-book/docs/` directory, where your textbook content is located.
2.  **Modernized Database Connection**: I've updated the script to use the latest standards for connecting to and creating collections in the Qdrant database.
3.  **Centralized Configuration**: The script now uses a single, reliable method for loading configuration, which has resolved the network errors you were seeing.
4.  **Added API Key Checks**: I've added checks for the required API keys.

To complete the process and ingest your data, you now need to edit the `rag-backend/.env` file and replace the placeholder values for `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual keys.

After you have updated the keys, you can run the ingestion command again and it will proceed with processing and indexing your content.
