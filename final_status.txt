The build process for both English and Urdu locales completed successfully! The previous errors regarding the translation file format and the missing image have been resolved.

You can now test your build locally using:
```bash
npm run serve
```
And navigate to `localhost:3000/ur/` to verify the full Urdu localization across all sections (Docs, Blog, Home Page) as requested.
